      Everything is negotiable. Challenge authority. You have the power in any
      situation. This is how to realize it and use it. A must-read classic from
      1980 from a master negotiator. My notes here aren’t enough because the
      little book is filled with so many memorable stories — examples of great
      day-to-day moments of negotiation that will stick in your head for when
      you need them. (I especially loved the one about the power of the prisoner
      in solitary confinement.) So go buy and read the book. I’m giving it a
      10/10 rating even though the second half of the book loses steam, because
      the first half is so crucial.
